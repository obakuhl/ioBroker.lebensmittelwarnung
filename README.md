## Credits
The implementation is mostly based on MCU's [Lebensmittel Warnungen](https://mcuiobroker.gitbook.io/jarvis-infos/jarvis-v3/system-effektprog./lebensmittel-warnungen) javascript. The logo has been taken from [lebensmittelwarnung.de](https://www.lebensmittelwarnung.de/) and has been modified to have a text next to the icon.
